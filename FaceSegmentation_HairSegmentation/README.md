# Overview
Use a U-net Machine Learning model and image segmentation to perform hair segmentation and face segmentation.

# Hair Segmentation
Use U-net Machine Learning model and various image segmentation techniques, such as rotation or shearing, to perform hair segmentation. I obtained 1st place in our class with my model.
